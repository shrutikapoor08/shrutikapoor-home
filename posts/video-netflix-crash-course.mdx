React 2025 Full Course – Build a Netflix Clone with Tailwind, TanStack & Zustand
Give this video a BIG THUMBS UP. I will make the backend version when I receive 500 likes.

Learn React in 2025 by building a Netflix Clone from scratch in this complete crash course. We’ll cover everything from React 19 fundamentals to advanced topics like state management with Zustand, routing with TanStack Router, data fetching with TanStack Query, authentication with Clerk, and performance optimization. Along the way, you’ll set up your project with Vite and TypeScript, style it with Tailwind CSS, and integrate APIs to fetch movie data. By the end, you’ll have a fully responsive Netflix-style web app complete with search, infinite scroll, a video player, and deployment to Vercel or Netlify. This hands-on project is designed to take you from beginner to advanced React developer and give you a portfolio-worthy project to showcase in interviews.
